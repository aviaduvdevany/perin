# Google OAuth Verification Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Google OAuth verification audit for the Perin application. The audit covers all aspects required for Google's OAuth verification process, including security, compliance, and implementation details.

## Audit Results Overview

### Overall Compliance Score: 7/10

**Status:** ⚠️ **READY WITH CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED**

The application demonstrates strong data minimization practices and user control features but has critical security gaps that must be addressed before Google OAuth verification approval.

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ PASS - Data Minimization & Limited Use

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive data minimization (only metadata stored)
- Clear Limited Use compliance (no ads, no selling, no unrelated ML)
- User-requested features only
- Minimal data retention policies

**Evidence:**

- Gmail: Only message metadata (sender, subject, date, snippets)

- No full email bodies stored
- Clear purpose limitation for all data access

### ✅ PASS - User Control & Legal Framework

**Strengths:**

- Complete disconnect functionality implemented
- Professional privacy policy and terms of service
- Clear user rights disclosure
- Proper OAuth consent flow

**Evidence:**

## Google OAuth Form Submission

### Ready-to-Use Text Blocks

**Calendar Scopes:**

```
Perin uses Google Calendar solely to help users schedule meetings. With calendar.readonly, Perin reads calendars to determine availability and show upcoming events. With calendar.events, Perin creates/updates/cancels events only when the user requests it (e.g., "Schedule with Dana Tuesday 10:00–10:30"). We store minimal metadata (eventId, start/end, attendees) to keep events in sync. OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest; all data is transmitted over TLS. Users can disconnect integration at any time, which revokes tokens and deletes stored Google event metadata per our retention policy. No data is sold or used for advertising, and use is limited to the functionality described in our Privacy Policy and Terms.
```

**Gmail Scopes:**

```
Perin uses Gmail to help users draft and send replies they explicitly approve. With gmail.readonly, Perin reads the relevant message thread to prepare context; with gmail.send, Perin sends the user-approved reply from the user's mailbox. Perin does not delete messages or change settings. We store only minimal message identifiers required to keep conversation state. Tokens are encrypted at rest; data is transmitted over TLS. Users can disconnect at any time, which revokes tokens and deletes stored Gmail identifiers per our retention policy. No data is sold or used for ads; use complies with Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use).
```

**Limited Use Statement:**

```
Perin limits Google user data access to the minimum necessary to provide user-requested features. We do not sell data or use it for advertising. Google data is not transferred to third parties except sub-processors essential to providing the service (listed in our Privacy Policy). OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest; data in transit uses HTTPS/TLS. Users can disconnect integrations at any time, which revokes tokens and triggers deletion of stored Google identifiers/metadata in accordance with our retention policy. Perin's use of Google user data complies with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
```

### Required URLs

- **Privacy Policy:** `https://perin.ai/legal/privacy-policy`
- **Terms of Service:** `https://perin.ai/legal/terms-of-service`
- **Homepage:** `https://perin.ai`
- **Support:** `hello@perin.ai`

## Demo Video Requirements

### Script Duration: 90-120 seconds

### Key Scenes:

1. **OAuth Consent (15-20s):** Show Google consent screen with scope explanations
2. **Calendar Read (20-25s):** Demonstrate availability checking
3. **Calendar Create (20-25s):** Show event creation with user approval
4. **Gmail Read (25-30s):** Demonstrate email reading and context
5. **Email Send (15-20s):** Show user approval and sending
6. **Disconnect (10-15s):** Demonstrate disconnect and token revocation

### Success Criteria:

- Clear scope explanations in OAuth consent
- Limited data access (metadata only)
- User control and approval for all actions
- Proper disconnect with token revocation
- Security best practices demonstrated

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues

1. **Token Security:** Plain text storage creates data breach risk
2. **Token Persistence:** Tokens remain valid after disconnect
3. **API Abuse:** No rate limiting on Google API endpoints

### Medium Risk Issues

1. **Security Headers:** Missing headers reduce security posture
2. **Contact Information:** Incomplete contact details in privacy policy
3. **Audit Logging:** Limited audit trail for security events

### Low Risk Issues

1. **Scope Optimization:** Could reduce Gmail scope to minimal required
2. **Monitoring:** No real-time security monitoring
3. **Documentation:** Some technical details could be better documented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Google Submission)

1. **Implement token encryption** using provided patch
2. **Add token revocation** functionality
3. **Deploy security headers** enhancement
4. **Add Google API rate limiting**
5. **Update privacy policy** with missing contacts
6. **Test all functionality** with security enhancements

### Post-Approval Improvements

1. **Implement monitoring** and alerting
2. **Add comprehensive audit logging**
3. **Consider scope reduction** to minimal required
4. **Enhance security documentation**
5. **Regular security audits**

## Conclusion

The Perin application demonstrates strong data minimization practices and user control features that align well with Google's OAuth requirements. However, critical security gaps in token storage and management must be addressed before Google OAuth verification approval.

**Key Strengths:**

- Excellent data minimization and Limited Use compliance
- Comprehensive user control and disconnect functionality
- Professional legal framework and documentation
- Clear OAuth flow and consent process

**Critical Gaps:**

- Token encryption and security
- Token revocation on disconnect
- Security headers and rate limiting
- Complete contact information

**Recommendation:** Address the critical security issues using the provided patches and implementation guides, then proceed with Google OAuth verification submission. The application is well-positioned for approval once security requirements are met.

**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to implement all required fixes and complete Google OAuth verification process.
